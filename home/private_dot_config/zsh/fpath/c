# This allows you to quickly jump into your favorite directory.  
# The original idea is stolen from Holman's dotfiles.  
#  
# Usage:  
#  
#   c [tab]  
#  
# ...to autocomplete all of your projects in the directories specified in  
# `functions/_c`. Typically, I use it like this:  
#  
#   c b[tab]  
#  
# ...to quickly jump into ~/websites/blog. I also use the alias `cn` for `code -n .`  
# to open a new window in VS Code without moving my hands away from the keyboard.
